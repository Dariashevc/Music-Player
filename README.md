# Music-Player
CS10 MAIN PROJECT
My music player will have menu with playlists. It will have dark and light mode. Then I go to the menu of the playlist and I can see all songs that I add there. When I start a song it will open a new page where I can see image of the song, song timeline and song switch  buttons.
